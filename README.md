# SmartPaste

int v0 = 0u;

int v1 = 0u;

smart pastes:

int v2 = 0u;

Just like done in excel tables to continue the linear sequence of numbers, but can be done with more than one number:

int v0 = 0u;
int v1 = 2u;

smart pastes:

int v2 = 4u;

The next number is automatically deduced from the value in the selected text and in the previous text.
It also respects zeros at the left. If no text is selected it will take the current line.

Better try it your self! just drag and drop the .jar into your dropins folder and press ctrl+9.
